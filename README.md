# Challenge One

## Description

In this challenge project, I have reworked a code to make it more accessable. The non-semantic elements have been changed to semantic elements, and alt text have been added where needed.

It is important to keep sites accessible for everyone, browser optimization is an important part of the work flow.

While working on this, I learnt how to use semantic elements.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

By rewieving the code, we can get examples for the use of semantic elements.
We can also open the site and use the develoer window to look at elements.

## Credits

Used the starter code that was provided for this project, containing the non-semantic version of the site.
